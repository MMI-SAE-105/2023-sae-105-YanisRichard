        <p> I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold, also known as The Figure 5 in Gold,[1] is a 1928 painting by American artist Charles Demuth. It has been described as influenced by Futurism and Cubism.
            William Carlos Williams claims that the inspiration for the 32-word poem "The Great Figure"[2] (1920) came from seeing a fire engine pass him by, sounding gong clangs and siren howls as it receded in the night. 
              He said he was so struck by the sight that he took paper and pencil out of his pocket and wrote the poem, standing there on the sidewalk.[3] Two lines: "I saw the figure 5/in gold" were taken by Demuth for his painting's title.[4] 
             The upper right corner has an arc, implying a fragment of a large number five, repeated three times in progressively smaller, complete number fives to create an impression of the fire engine moving away from the viewer. 
             The fire engine itself is reduced to an abstracted form composed of red rectangles, but there is a hint of a ladder on the right side and an axle across the bottom. Above the truck are globular streetlamps flanked by sidewalks and buildings in blacks and grays.
               Demuth conveyed his friendship with Williams by incorporating fragments of his name: "Bill" across the top, and "CARLO" (the "O" cut off and the "S" missing entirely) in yellow dots as in an illuminated theater sign. Across the bottom the painter has placed his own initials "C.D." and also the poet's "W.C.W." in the same size and color.[3]</p>
